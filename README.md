## Prerequisites
To try out this scraper, you need several prerequisites set up.

I am assuming you already have a Python installation on your machine. If not, please download the latest Python from the official website.

The Requests and Beautiful Soup libraries don't come with Python. You will have to install them separately. For this, you can use the pip package manager which is included by default with Python installation since Python 3.4.

You can use pip to install the Requests and Beautiful Soup libraries using the following commands:

`pip install regex`

`pip install requests`

If they were successfully installed, now you are ready to start building your Scraper.

## Steps used here
Step 1: Import Necessary Libraries
Step 2: Define the Base URL and CSV Headers
Step 3: Create a Function to Scrape Dataset Details
Step 4: Create a Function to Scrape Dataset Listings
Step 5: Loop Through Pages Using Pagination Parameters
Step 6: Save the Scraped Data to a CSV File
Step 7: Run the Scraping Function

## Keep in Mind
Please note that while a web scraper is a useful tool, make sure you're compliant with all legal guidelines. This involves respecting the website's `robots.txt` file and adhering to the terms of service so you avoid unauthorized data extraction.

Also, before scraping, make sure that the scraping process does not harm the website's functionality or overload its servers. Finally, respect data privacy by not scraping personal or sensitive information without proper consent.
Using Python along with Requests and Beautiful Soup allows you to create fully functional web scrapers to extract data from websites. While this functionality can be highly advantageous for data-driven decision-making, it is important to keep ethical and legal considerations in mind.

Once you become familiar with the methods used in this script, you can explore techniques like proxy management and data persistence. You can also familiarize yourself with other libraries like Scrapy, Selenium, and Puppeteer to fulfill your data collection needs.
